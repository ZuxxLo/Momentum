## Momentum: Build Better Habits

Effective Date: 13/09/2024

At Momentum, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. Our app is designed to work entirely offline, meaning we do not collect, store, or share any personal information.

### 1. No Personal Information Collection
Momentum does not require you to create an account or submit any personal information. All features, including habit tracking, reminders, and quizzes, function locally on your device.

### 2. Local Data Storage
All data is stored on your phone. Momentum does not access or transfer this information to external servers or third parties.

### 3. No Data Sharing
Since we do not collect any information, we do not share any data with third parties. Your information is kept private and secure on your device.

### 4. Notifications
Momentum uses local notifications to remind you of your goals. These reminders are generated and managed entirely on your device.

### 5. Unrestricted Battery Access
Momentum requires unrestricted battery access to provide reliable reminder notifications. This permission ensures that the app can send reminders on time, even when your phone is in low-power mode or the app is running in the background.

### 6. Security of Your Data
The security of your data is based on the measures you take to protect your device. We do not control access to your phone or its contents.

### 7. Changes to the Privacy Policy
This policy may be updated in the future, but any changes will reflect our commitment to privacy. Updates will be communicated through the app.
